# Cellular Automata

This is a simple Qt/QML application for a two dimensional cellular automata with toroidal border rules.

I used QQuickPaintedItem inheritance to import a pure Qt canvas into QML.

Here are some cool automata rules for you to check out:

122415 - city
333333 - rectangular islands
8458232 - supposed to be cool
9367426 - forests grow

Fractals:
