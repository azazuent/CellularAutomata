# Cellular Automata

This is a simple Qt/QML application for a two dimensional cellular automata with toroidal border rules.

I used QQuickPaintedItem inheritance to import a pure Qt canvas into QML.

You can find a link to the current deployed version of the application in the files. Check it out!
